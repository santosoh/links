    # Introduction
    Grab Link REST API is developed to provide standard interface for merchant to accept payment from website or app. As some API may contain sensitive data in request/response message, merchant need to ensure that their environment is complied with PCI DSS security standard requirements before using those API.

    If merchant's environment is not complied with PCI DSS requirement, Hosted Payment Page API can be implemented instead, where consumer will be redirected to Grab Link payment page to complete the transaction.

    # Idempotency
    Every API request from merchant to Grab Link may contain Idempotency-Key in the header (except for HTTP GET request), and used to identify subsequent retries of the same request, ie. if a request is sent with same Idempotency-Key with same details, eg. amount, payment method, etc, Grab Link will simply return previously completed response without performing any new action. Conversely, API request will return error If duplicate Idempotency-Key is sent with different details to prevent accidental usage.

    Idempotency-Key will be kept for 24 hours, and any request with the same Idempotency-Key beyond that time frame will be considered as a new request.

    # Encryption
    Other than raw PAN, merchant may encrypt the card data before sending through API.

    Grab Link will provides iOS and Android SDK to support merchant app to perform encryption, as well as web SDK to support merchant website.

    # Webhook
    Merchant is able to set webhook endpoint for supported payment events on Grab Link Merchant Portal, and the result of any API request will be posted to this endpoint. This is especially necessary when the customer is redirected to another website (eg. in the case of 3D Secure Authentication).

    # Signature Hash
    Merchant need to calculate signature hash and include it in header, to ensure data integrity when consuming Grab Link API. Each merchant will be assigned with a secret key, and this key would be used when generating HMAC signature.

    ### Step to generate HMAC signature:
    1. Generate timestamp (unix timestamp)
    2. Concatenate request-body with timestamp in the following format:
    concatenated-string = {request-body} + ",t={timestamp}"
    3. Calculate HMAC using SHA512 hashing
    signature-hash = hmac-sha512(concatenated-string, {secret-key})
    4. Set the hex string representation of the HMAC result to upper case, and use it as the signature hash in base64 encoding format.
    5. Include Timestamp to header
    6. Include Signature to header

    ### Sample:
    ### Example of message to be signed
    ```json

    ### Signature Calculation
    ```sh
    $body = ... // 'refer to the sample message above'
    $hash_secret = get_hash_secret() // 'example: 007d252f0d0e47f9965589b7f7d011ba'
    $timestamp = get_timestamp() // 'example: 1620978893'
    $concatenated_string = $body + ",t=" + $timestamp
    $signature = hmac_sha512($concatenated_string, $hash_secret) // '10ecc1da78c0bed907b2c42f518c482bbe501c758955858adcb4c353ac1675ccc0bd32a84bae3db62757bb46e676a8ca25c3b0104ff086325f7e8a5d8e52a0ed'
    $signature = upper_case($signature) // '10ECC1DA78C0BED907B2C42F518C482BBE501C758955858ADCB4C353AC1675CCC0BD32A84BAE3DB62757BB46E676A8CA25C3B0104FF086325F7E8A5D8E52A0ED'
